# Contributing Guidelines

## Issues and Comments

* Feel free to comment on issues and Pull Requests.
* Feel free to open an issue to report a bug, request a feature, make questions, open discussions, etc ...

## Pull requests

0. The contributors are encouraged to read the issues first to see if there is any hot issue to solve. If you are new, "good first issues" are a good start
1. If you already have something in mind, check if there is an existing issue related to the foreseen update. If not, create an issue describing the bugfix or the feature addition it is going to cover. Try to be specific. Prefer multiple simple issues over a single complex one
2. Assign an issue to yourself (or ask the maintainers to do it) to avoid other people to work on the same thing
3. Implement and test the updates locally
4. Open a pull request to the 'main' branch. Make sure to:
   - Describe the update
   - Close the associated issue(s) using [keywords] (https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise/2.16/user/github/managing-your-work-on-github/closing-issues-using-keywords) (eg "Close #IssueNumber")
   - List any PR it depends on
5. Wait for the CI tests and the reviews (you can start solving eventual problems detected by the CI tests before the reviews)
6. Check the review comments and interact with the reviewers. Implement any required fix or update
7. The maintainers will approve and merge when it is considered to be good shape to merge
